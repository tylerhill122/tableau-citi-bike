## Noted Phenomenom

### The number of trips per month increases from the start of the year (as the weather warms)

This observation makes sense as the number of trips taken is lowest in the coolest months (in our limited dataset). Once the weather begins to warm around April, the average number of rides per month starts to increase drastically. This could be explained by people opting for ride-share or other forms of private or public transportation to get to their destinations rather than brave the cold weather.

### Stations with the longest average trip durations were located across the Hudson River in New Jersey

The stations with the longest trip durations tended to be the stations located furthest from Manhattan. This would seem to indicate that the people furthest from the city may have to ride further in order to catch a bus or train into the city.
